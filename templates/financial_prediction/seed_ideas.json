    "Experiment": "1. Compute technical indicators (e.g., moving averages, RSI) from the historical stock price data provided. 2. Construct a Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN) with multiple dilation rates to capture both short-term and long-term dependencies from the internal data. 3. Combine the computed technical indicators with raw historical features in a fully connected layer for binary stock movement prediction. 4. Compare performance with a baseline MLP model and analyze which time scales most influence the prediction.",

    "Experiment": "1. Derive technical indicators (e.g., MACD, RSI, Bollinger Bands) from the historical stock price data. 2. Train a linear model (e.g., ridge regression) and a deep MLP model separately on these computed features to capture both linear and nonlinear relationships. 3. Fuse the outputs of the individual models using weighted averaging or a stacking ensemble to improve prediction robustness. 4. Evaluate the ensemble's performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score, and compare it with the individual models.",
