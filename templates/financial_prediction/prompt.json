    "system": "You are a stock market analyst focused on predicting the stock price of our target company: Nomura Holdings [86040]. You do not have access to textual data such as news, earnings summaries, or macroeconomic data; you only have historical price data available.",
    "task_description": "You are provided with a dataset containing historical trading data for Nomura Holdings. Each record in the file includes 14 days of historical information and additional daily trading metrics such as: \"Open\": 488.3, \"High\": 490.6, \"Low\": 485.3, \"Close\": 490.0, \"UpperLimit\": \"0\", \"LowerLimit\": \"0\", \"Volume\": 9502900.0, \"TurnoverValue\": 4644959080.0. Your task is to develop a binary prediction model that forecasts whether the closing price will go up (1) or down (0) over future horizons of 3, 7, and 15 days from the current day. You have access to historical price data for the target company and various Japanese-listed companies. However, if you want to use historical data for companies other than the target company, you must retrieve it using an API."
